                                <abbr title="Data Structures and Algorithms ">DSA</abbr> form the backbone of computer science and software development, serving as the foundation for solving computational problems efficiently. At its core, <strong><abbr title="Data Structures and Algorithms ">DSA</abbr> is about organizing data in meaningful ways and designing step-by-step procedures to manipulate that data effectively.</strong> Whether you're managing a small list of items or building a complex system like a search engine, understanding how to choose the right data structure—such as arrays, linked lists, trees, or graphs—and applying the appropriate algorithm can make a significant difference in performance. These concepts are universal, transcending programming languages and platforms, making them essential for anyone pursuing a career in technology.

                            The importance of learning DSA cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the efficiency and scalability of software systems. Efficient algorithms reduce processing time and resource usage, which is critical when dealing with large datasets or real-time applications. For instance, using a hash table for quick lookups can drastically improve the speed of a database query, while a well-implemented sorting algorithm ensures that data is organized for faster access. In a world increasingly driven by data, mastering <abbr title="Data Structures and Algorithms ">DSA</abbr> equips developers with the tools to write optimized code, minimize bottlenecks, and build systems that can handle growing demands without compromising performance.

                                When I first started tackling Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, I quickly realized that the most important step is understanding the question. It’s tempting to jump straight into coding, especially when you’re eager to solve a problem, but trust me—this approach rarely works. I remember spending hours on a LeetCode problem called Trapping Rain Water because I misunderstood what was being asked. Once I slowed down, read the problem multiple times, and wrote out examples by hand, everything clicked. Breaking the problem into smaller parts and identifying inputs, outputs, and constraints makes it much easier to approach. Another is by getting the different test cases. For example, what happens if the input array is empty? Or if all elements are identical? These considerations save you from bugs later on. Taking the time to fully grasp the problem sets the foundation for an effective solution.

                                One of the best practices I picked up during my studies at Mapúa was writing pseudocode before diving into actual implementation. Pseudocode allows you to focus on logic without getting bogged down by syntax or language-specific quirks. When I worked on Largest Rectangle in Histogram , a notoriously tricky "hard" problem on LeetCode, pseudocoding helped me visualize the steps needed to compute areas efficiently using a stack. Instead of worrying about whether I had semicolons in the right places, I could concentrate on the flow of operations: iterating through heights, pushing indices onto the stack, and calculating maximum areas. Writing pseudocode also makes debugging easier since you can trace your thought process step-by-step.

                                Early in my journey with DSA, I fell into the trap of trying to optimize my solutions too soon. I’d obsess over making every line of code run faster, even before ensuring that my basic solution worked correctly. Then I came across Donald Knuth’s famous quote: 
                            </p> <!-- actual experiences -->
    
                            <blockquote class="fs20">
                                <i>We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.</i>
                            </blockquote>
    
                            <p class="small-text">
                                This resonated deeply with me because I realized how often I sacrificed clarity for minor performance gains that didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. For instance, while solving Trapping Rain Water , I initially tried to implement a two-pointer technique right away instead of starting with a brute-force approach. It wasn’t until I stepped back and built a simpler version that I understood the underlying mechanics of the problem.

                            Big O notation is a fundamental concept in computer science used to describe the efficiency of algorithms, specifically their time and space complexity. It classifies algorithms based on how their runtime or memory usage grows with input size. For example, O(1) represents constant time operations like accessing an array element, which are highly efficient regardless of input size, while O(log n) , seen in binary search, demonstrates logarithmic growth, making it ideal for large datasets. Linear time (O(n)) is common in simple traversals, and O(n log n) is typical for efficient sorting algorithms like MergeSort and QuickSort. However, as we move into quadratic time (O(n<sup>2</sup>)), cubic time (O(n<sup>3</sup>)), or worse (e.g., exponential O(2<sup>n</sup>) or factorial O(n!) time), the performance degrades significantly, especially with larger inputs. These higher complexity classes should generally be avoided unless absolutely necessary, as they can lead to impractical runtimes for real-world applications. As a rule of thumb, <mark>strive for algorithms with lower growth rates to ensure scalability and efficiency.</mark> To emphasize this point:

Think of it like this: every time we use the Internet, smartphones, or smart home devices, we create tons of information.
